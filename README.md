### Day00 - Mathematical Delights
**Understand useful mathematical functions and formulas**
> Sum, mean, variance, standard deviation, vectors and matrices operations.

### Day01 - Linear Regression
**Get started with the first concepts constituting the field of Machine Learning**
> Matrix operations, gradient descent, cost function, normal equation, MSE, RMSE R-score and learning rate.

### Day02 - Logistic Regression
**Implement a Logistic Regression class using a Gradient Descent algorithm**
> Sigmoid, log loss, gradient descent, logistic regression, model evaluation, confusion matrix.

### Day03 - Feature Engineering and Regularization
**See the L2 regularization and a few ways to process your data in order to improve significantly the performance of your models!**
> Regularization, regularized linear regression, regularized logistic regression, Z-score standardization, min-max standardization, polynomial features, interaction terms.

### Day04 - Decision Tree :deciduous_tree: (not finished)
**Be able to use Decision Trees algorithms wisely in the future**
> Gini impurity, entropy, information gain and decision trees.
