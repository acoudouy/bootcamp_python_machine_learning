### Day00 - Stepping Into Machine Learning
**Get started with some linear algebra and statistics**
> Sum, mean, variance, standard deviation, vectors and matrices operations.  
Hypothesis, model, regression, cost function. 

### Day01 - Univariate Linear Regression
**Implement a method to improve your model's performance: **gradient descent**, and discover the notion of normalization**
> Gradient descent, linear regression, normalization.

### Day02 - Multivariate Linear Regression
**Extend the linear regression to handle more than one features, build polynomial models and detect overfitting**
> Multivariate linear hypothesis, multivariate linear gradient descent, polynomial models.  
Training and test sets, overfitting.

### Day03 - Logistic Regression
**Discover your first classification algorithm: logistic regression!**
> Logistic hypothesis, logistic gradient descent, logistic regression, multiclass classification.  
Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.

### Day04 - Regularization
**Fight overfitting!**
> Regularization, overfitting. Regularized cost function, regularized gradient descent.  
Regularized linear regression. Regularized logistic regression.
